# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I love to read non-fiction during my leisure time. I especially enjoy the fields of physics, mathematics economics. You can also find me tinkering with the latest and shiniest frameworks, and getting a new perspective wherever I can. I enjoy a variety of sports, including Chess, Skiing, Table-tennis and running.
