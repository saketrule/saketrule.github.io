# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a graduate student studying Data Science at Harvard University, currently interning at Twitter in San Francisco, CA. I did my undergraduate education in Computer Science at IIT Tirupati, and am especially interested in Machine learning, Software engineering and computational finance (Physics is my favorite though).  I love to read non-fiction and in my free time, you will find me tinkering with the latest and shiniest frameworks, and trying to get a new perspective wherever possible. I also enjoy a variety of sports, including Chess, Skiing, Table-tennis and running.
