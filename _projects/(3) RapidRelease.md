# RapidRelease
#### A Filtered Dataset Of Open-Source Repositories With Fast Release Cycles
<br>

+ Published in  **2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on MiningSoftware Repositories (MSR)**.
+ A classification scheme was used to identify open-source projects with fast, active release cycles for release engineering analysis.
+ The RapidRelease dataset features 214 open-source projects, with almost 900,000 issue reports.
+ Data mined from Github API v3.
+ Applications in the study of Open-source development, Continuous integration and release engineering. Also provides a standard set of mature projects for benchmarking.
