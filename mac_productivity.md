Keeping tab of shortcuts & tools I'm using to increase speed.

#### Chrome
- In `chrome://settings/accessibillity`, enabled option to show highlight on the focused object.
- Installed extension [`Web search Navigator`](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/search%20keyboard%20navigator?hl=en!)

The shortcuts I'm using - 
```
Tab/Shift tab  - To switch focus
Arrow keys - To navigate search results
Command + arrow keys - To go back/ forward
```

Just basic navigation (80% of chrome use is google searches) is enough for now to jump speed

#### Window management
`Optimal Layout` from the Mac app store. Set key bindings to snap window to any half.

```
Shift + Command + <arrow keys> : snap to half of screen
Shift + Command + F : Full size snap
```
